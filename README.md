# StakeHouse

StakeHouse has grown into a community focused on building tools that lower the technical bar to staking and promote the health of the beacon chain.  Come say hi!

We live on the EthStaker [discord](https://invite.gg/ethstaker) in the #stakehouse channel and check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/stake-house/stakehouse) for more details and our growing collection of tools!

## One-click Installer

StakeHouse the one-click installer has been renamed to [Wagyu](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu) and is one of the core focuses of StakeHouse's development.  


The Wizard still lives [here](https://github.com/remyroy/eth2-validator-wizard), and is another core focus of StakeHouse.
